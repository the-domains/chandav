"If you just get out of your own way it's amazing what will come to you" 
~Laird Hamilton~ 

It's 2015 and as with the begining of every year we probably can't help but look back and think of the things we want to change and the fresh starts we would like to make. 

We have probably already made superficial promises to ourselves, although with the best of intentions. We will get in shape, go back to church, learn a new sport or language. We will certainly do "THIS" and we definitely won't do or take "THAT" anymore ....and so on, because this is a new year baby! If we are lucky we make it four weeks. 

Then there are the more genuine promises we make, maybe to ourselves or others, out loud or in the privacy of our minds such as to volunteer more, communicate better or make amends with those we have wronged. 

Regardless of the promises we make, if they are to have any purpose or longevity, we must first get out of our own way. We must allow ourselves to let go of the pretence and the hurtful habits and to come face to face with our fears. In doing this we will start to find our way to a place of self love. The place where the truth of our resolutions can firmly take root and be nourished into a meaningful transfirmation. 

So if there is one promise you make and keep this year, let it be to start moving out of your own way so you can reveil the path to self love. Please keep in mind that the path to self love is a journey that in both content and length will be different for each of us. But if you are patient and honest with yourself the end result is unmistakably the same; a happier more fulfilling life. 

If you're not sure where to begin, start here:
