"When I think of working with Chanda I think of the personal power I've gained in her presence. Her coaching has supported me in taking chances, being bold, and taking a closer look at all aspects of my life. She encourages compassion, self-love, and lighting a fire for growth. She's not afraid to say what I need to hear, and I appreciate her honesty and dedication. Chanda fans a flame in my life, and I know the shifts I've had are because of our work together. She has a gift for this work, and I am excited to continue our work together."
