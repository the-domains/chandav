title: "Do you give away your happiness? If you ever find yourself saying \"if only I had more money, more time, someone who loved me or my dream job....I'd be happy\" - I invite you to consider who you are giving your happiness away to. We often condition our happiness (our being) by making it dependent on or circumstances. We don't realize how powerless that makes us. What if I came to you randomly and told you that you could not be happy unless I said so. I'm sure that wouldn't go over well. You might even have a few choice words for me. So what gives money, time, love, or careers the power to say that to you and have you surrender to it no questions asked? What's that you say? That's just the way it is and there's nothing you can do about it? But what if there were? And what if it was were simple and extremely powerful? What if all you had to do was CHOOSE to be happy? Yeah, choose. Incredibly simple huh? And really powerful. How does that feel? We empower what we choose and to be happy or unhappy is simply a CHOICE. What do you chose?"
